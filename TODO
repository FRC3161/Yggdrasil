- Update lib directory (new 2015 FRC library JARs)

- Add basic Eclipse configuration for quick first time setup for developers

- Port src to Java 8/new FRC libraries (awaiting kickoff and 2015 Control
Systems release)

- Remove 'Class Overview' from README, or at least pare it down - javadocs
should be sufficient
