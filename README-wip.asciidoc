== WORK IN PROGRESS
This repository is very barren! Please check back after the
link:http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/calendar/frc-kickoff-2015[FRC 2015 Kickoff Event]
on 3 January 2015. At Kickoff, the new control systems update will be released,
and shortly after we hope to be publishing a ported version of last year's
library, provided as a ready-to-go Eclipse project with all of our sources, and
pre-built binaries (JARs) available through our website as well.
